# Workshop introduction

This is a self-worked tutorial on packaging. 
Each section starts with a little introduction before you start working on exercises.
However, these exercises are a bit different from what you might be used to: you will be asked to do things, possibly without knowing what it does or understanding why.
Then, when you are finished with a set of exercises, there's a reflection text for you to read, where your questions hopefully are answered.
If you participate in a live session, we also ask you to put a yellow post-it note on the back of your laptop after finishing a set of exercises to signify that you are ready to move on.
Specifically, put a yellow post it note on your laptop when you get to this symbol:

Once most tutorial participants have finished an exercise and placed yellow post it notes on their laptops, we will have a short recap together where we demonstrate the exercises and discuss what we have learned before moving on to a new topic.

If you have any questions, then please attach a pink post-it note on the back of your laptop screen, and we'll do our best to help you.

**PS:** While it's often faster to copy-paste code and commands, we recommend that you type them in manually unless otherwise stated (at least for most of them), as this will make it easier to remember the commands in the future.
